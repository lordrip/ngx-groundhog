# Context Menu

The Angular Groundhog Context Menu creates a menu thats hidden inside an overlay. It is possible to disable the entire context menu or the items within. Each item within is rendered as a `gh-button`. The context menu traps the focus inside the overlay until it is closed again. It sets the focus to the previously focused element when closed.

**Example**
```html
<gh-context-menu>
  <gh-context-menu-item>Edit</gh-context-menu-item>
  <gh-context-menu-item>Approve</gh-context-menu-item>
  <gh-context-menu-item (onClick)="delete()">Delete</gh-context-menu-item>
</gh-context-menu>
```

## Accessibility

Context menus without should be given a meaningful label via aria-label, because the button does not have a text.
